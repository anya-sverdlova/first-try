ann(selector) -->

if selector = id, return null

if selector = tag, return DOM-elements with this tags

if selector = class, return DOM-elements wits this class (as single NodeList)

if selector = more than one class, return more than one NodeLists each with DOM-elements with this classes (NodeList in NodeList, I have an acces to elements using NodeList[0][0] for example)

ISSUES

1. Correct RegExp: make it find classes with "-" ang tags with numbers

2. Try to get classes (if its in plural) in one NodeList, not in two different arrays
 
3. Finish part with HTTPrequest

Finish those part of code which get tag+class - DONE

Finish part which will get tags with two different classes - DONE
